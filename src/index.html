	<h1>About me</h1><br>
	<p>I'm currently a college student in Mississauga, Canada, studying computer science. Originally I'm from Egypt but I have lived most of my life in the United Arab Emirates.
	I'm very passionate about programming and the computer science field in general, I haven't made up my mind yet on what to specialize in since I find most of the languages Interesting
	which I have studied interesting and useful. I have always excelled in my I.T classes in school and have recieved a grade of 85% in my first year of college.
